# ISI Camera

![](./../../images/ov5640_arducam.png)

This demonstration shows how to use the SAM9X60-EK Image Sensor Interface peripheral with an off-the-shelf image sensor. For this example, an arducam OV5640
Camera Module is used. The application will store the captured images to a USB storage device in TGA format. When user pushes SW1 button, a full-size ISI codec 
capture is initiated and the image is stored in the USB storage device.
